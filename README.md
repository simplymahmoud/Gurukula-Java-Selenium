# What needs to be done:

Please add information with respect to framework, tests covered, how to launch automation tests  and any other information to a document in the same Git hub location. 


# Folders:

manual: for manual test cases.

auto: for auto test cases written in (python, java, js).

auto/testplan: containing the test plan suggested for the testsuites to cover the usecases.

# Idea: 
It was prefered to do it in Java/Selenium with junit or testng but after I made a good research I found that it will not be the best solution. As the project using AngularJs so the best solution is to use Protractor with any java script test framework like jasmine/cucumberjs/moca/karma, I made it with Jasmine. I found that we have another solution to test this project based on python/selenium/unittest but not pure selenium it's through pytractor, so I use it too.
